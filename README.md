# My DSA Journey

Welcome to my repository, where I chronicle my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), primarily focusing on the C programming language. This repository serves as both a personal tracker and a resource for others who are on a similar path.

## Language Focus: C

In this section, I delve into the intricacies of C syntax, a fundamental language in the world of algorithms and data structures. My goal is to master the nuances of C and demonstrate how it can be effectively used in solving complex DSA problems.

## Weekly Progress: DSA Challenges

Here's a breakdown of my weekly progress:

- **Week 1**: Introduction to basic data structures and algorithmic thinking.


This section is a weekly log of the DSA problems I tackle. Each week, I aim to learn new concepts and apply them to practical problems. It's a journey of continuous learning and improvement.

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or share your own experiences. This journey is not just about code, but about growing together as a community of learners and developers.

**Happy Coding!**
